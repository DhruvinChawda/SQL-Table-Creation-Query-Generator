Input your table name, column name, column type, row number, column number and It will generate you the query for table creation with random row values. Copy paste that query to create table. Easy for generating quick tables.

Project under development this is the first prototype of the model.
Inspired by my laziness to write query everytime if want to create new table. 
Hope y'all find this useful. 
Happy Coding!â˜•
